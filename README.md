**Project Objective:**

The objective of this project is to analyze the Netflix dataset using advanced SQL techniques to extract meaningful insights about content trends, user preferences, and platform distribution. The project leverages SQL subqueries, Common Table Expressions (CTEs), and window functions to perform in-depth data analysis. This includes identifying the most frequent genres, understanding the release trends over the years, examining country-wise content distribution, and ranking shows based on duration and popularity.

To solve these problems efficiently, I used a combination of:

Subqueries for filtering and conditional analysis,

Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for improving query modularity and readability,

Window Functions to rank, group, and aggregate data dynamically across partitions.

This project aims to simulate data-driven decision-making tasks that a data analyst at Netflix might face, enhancing my SQL proficiency and business insight.

**Project Conclusion:**

Through this SQL-based Netflix data analysis project, I achieved the following:

1. Identified content distribution trends by type, genre, country, and release year.

2. Used window functions to find the longest movie and rank actors by appearances.

3. Applied subqueries and filters to analyze content with specific keywords like "Kill" and "Violence".

4. Employed CTEs for reusable logic in complex queries, such as calculating average yearly content for India or counting movies by specific actors and directors.

5. Extracted actionable insights like the most common rating, top-producing countries, and multi-season TV shows.
